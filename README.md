# AW_Hell
Unity Game  Project (Level Generator)


First step of the process. Developing the tools. It will be a 1meter grid on wich I create controlnodes which will be replaced by art assets on level initialisation. I want the levels to be truly random and not just big assets stuck together differently. Each of the 7 levels shall also be very different from all the others, so each one gets its own algorithm.

The first will be rooms on stilts over a red hot soup of lava and bodyparts (all very lighthearted, but still gross)
the rooms are connected by bridges and the whole structure is broken.
